But since we have a BLSTM model the other blocks output would also have the context to the entire utterance so averag pooling should also work. But maybe focusing on just one block's output makes it easier for the model to optimize weights sice we have a start and end token that are same across all the samples. It was also evident as when we didnt use the start and end tokens all the three models performed worst and the last block output method didnt do as good.\n",
